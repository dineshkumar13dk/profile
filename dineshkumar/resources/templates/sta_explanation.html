                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>The SMART TRAVELLERS APP (STA) is designed to simplify the travel of Public transport
                        networks(PTNs) it is difficult to use when the user is unfamiliar with the area they are
                        traveling. This is true for both infrequent users(including visitors)and regular users who
                        need to travel to areas with which they are not acquainted. In these situations, adequate
                        on-trip navigation information can substantially ease the use of public transportation and
                        be the driving factor in motivating travelers to prefer it over other modes of
                        transportation. However, estimating the localization of a user is not trivial, although it
                        is critical for providing relevant information. we assess relevant design issues for a
                        modular cost-efficient user-friendly on-trip Navigation service that uses position sensors
                        .By helping travelers move to single-occupancy vehicles to public transportation systems,
                        communities can reduce traffic congestion as well as its environmental impact. Here, we
                        describe our efforts to increase the satisfaction of current public transportation users and
                        help motivate more people to ride.

                        Flutter is a cross-platform software development framework that was presented by Google in 2015
                        and received its first release in May of 2017. Flutter nowadays has steadily grown and provided
                        possibilities not only for iOS and Android mobile development but also for web and desktop
                        applications as well. Let’s dive into the topic and try to understand why it is so popular
                        nowadays.

                    <h3>Dart</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dart is an object-oriented programming language that was first unveiled by Google in 2011. Since
                        then Dart steadily evolved by releasing different features. Among others, it is worth mentioning
                        the “dart2native” feature that allows compiling it for Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms as a
                        desktop application.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have presented my dissertation on the value of BEST information systems, demonstrating a
                        number of widely deployed tools and evaluations of those tools that show their utility.
                        Specifically, I have described the system, which provides riders tools across a Smartphone and
                        interfaces. I have demonstrated a real-time mobile trip planning tool and also a method for
                        crowd-sourcing the detection of errors in public transit data. Finally, I have presented
                        evaluations that show improves satisfaction with public transit, reduces wait times, increases
                        transit usage, encourages walking, and improves perception of safety among riders. Sustainable
                        urban mobility is a key factor for a citizen’s quality of life, as an increasingly larger amount
                        of the population lives in urban areas. The integration and interoperability of different
                        transport networks are seen in that document as a key feature for the improvement of urban
                        mobility, together with improved travel information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now this app is used for school and college in our next step to implement the public buses. The
                        future will be a different and the most innovative for the passengers which we can see from the
                        picture that how it would look in real. Artificial intelligence would be one of the technologies
                        that would makes the technology more significant and better in the coming years and AI would
                        provide huge technology in the same.
