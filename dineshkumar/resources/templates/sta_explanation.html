                    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                    <p>The SMART TRAVELLERS APP (STA) is designed to simplify the travel of Public transport
                        networks(PTNs) it is difficult to use when the user is unfamiliar with the area they are
                        traveling. This is true for both infrequent users(including visitors)and regular users who need
                        to travel to areas with which they are not acquainted. In these situations, adequate on-trip
                        navigation information can substantially ease the use of public transportation and be the
                        driving factor in motivating travelers to prefer it over other modes of transportation. However,
                        estimating the localization of a user is not trivial, although it is critical for providing
                        relevant information. we assess relevant design issues for a modular cost-efficient
                        user-friendly on-trip Navigation service that uses position sensors .By helping travelers move
                        to single-occupancy vehicles to public transportation systems, communities can reduce traffic
                        congestion as well as its environmental impact. Here, we describe our efforts to increase the
                        satisfaction of current public transportation users and help motivate more people to ride.</p>

                    <p>
                        Flutter is a cross-platform software development framework that was presented by Google in 2015
                        and received its first release in May of 2017. Flutter nowadays has steadily grown and provided
                        possibilities not only for iOS and Android mobile development but also for web and desktop
                        applications as well. Let’s dive into the topic and try to understand why it is so popular
                        nowadays.

                    <h3>Dart</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dart is an object-oriented programming language that was first unveiled by Google in 2011. Since
                        then Dart steadily evolved by releasing different features. Among others, it is worth mentioning
                        the “dart2native” feature that allows compiling it for Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms as a
                        desktop application.</p>
